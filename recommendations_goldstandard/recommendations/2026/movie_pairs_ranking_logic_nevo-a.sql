-- SECTION 2 - Movies Pairs Ranking
-- The query identifies pairs of potentially similar movies based on two rules:
-- 1. The movies must have been released within a maximum of 5 years apart.
--    This ensures they belong to a similar era of cinema, production quality, and cultural context.
-- 2. High Genre Overlap: The movies must share at least 3 genres in common.
--    This serves as a strong indicator of stylistic similarity.
